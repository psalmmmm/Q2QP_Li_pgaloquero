            <h1>INITIATIVES</h1>
            <p> WWF advocates for U.S. government policies and funding to promote the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity and halt the drivers of species loss globally, including habitat destruction, illegal wildlife trade, and human-wildlife conflict. WWF has a particular focus on the role that U.S. government programs play in supporting conservation in developing countries, which are home to some of our planet’s richest ecosystems.  </p>

            <h1>ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION</h1>
            
            <p>From the Arctic to the Eastern Himalayas, WWF works on every continent to halt and reverse declines in wildlife numbers and the unsustainable use of our natural resources. By working with partners on local and global levels, and supporting inclusive area-based conservation efforts, WWF aims to conserve many of the world’s most ecologically important regions.
